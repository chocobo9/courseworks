How to run my pman.c : Please enter "make" command in the terminal, then enter"./pman".

Buildin commands in pman: bg, bglist, bgkill, bgstart, bgstop, pstat, q (quit).
Code structure and main() method reference by help code in brightspace. Thanks!!

Note:     #####pstat() is partial finished, zombie process not kill in my pman, the value of utime & stime might be incorrect.#####

Big thanks for evaluating my assignment#1.
